// wraps a JS function as an ObjC block so it can be called from ObjC // TO DO: there is some overlap between this and create-class.js, so perhaps opportunities to consolidate?

// TO DO: what about ObjC properties/methods that return an ObjC block? for now, the block will appear as a pointer of type `@?`, which is how the ObjC introspection APIs represent all blocks, but without knowing its true type encoding (which is only defined in ObjC header and bridgesupport files), any block passed from ObjC *to* JS must remain opaque and uncallabel within JS; therefore, methods need to pack and unpack block arguments and return values using objc_opaqueblock_t


/*

  Example block type declaration from Foundation.bridgesupport

  <method selector='enumerateObjectsWithOptions:usingBlock:'>
    
    <arg function_pointer='true' index='1' type64='@?'>
      <arg type64='@'/>
      <arg type64='Q'/>
      <arg type64='^B' type_modifier='o'/>
      <retval type64='v'/>
    </arg>
    
  </method>

 note that bridgesupport defines each argument and return type separately; thus this block's type encoding is "v@Qo^B"
*/

// note: there is an argument here for using `const myBlock = new objc.Block(ENCODING, FUNCTION);`, which is also close to the existing `new objc.Ref()` syntax
//
// the counter-argument to this is that `objc.blocks.define(ENCODING[,NAME])` has advantage of being consistent with `objc.structs.define()` API without adding much usability overhead; e.g. if user doesnâ€™t give it a name (for reuse) then instantiating a new block is: `const myBlock = new (objc.blocks.define(ENCODING))(FUNCTION)`; additionally, separating the [named] BlockType definition from Block instantiation with callback function as argument means that BlockTypes can be automatically defined on `objc.blocks` from .bridgesupport-generated or manually-written framework libraries
//
// therefore we will adopt the objc.structs style API and (to KISS) not expose the Block constructor's all-in-one API; instead hiding it behind a [sub]class expression that acts as a closure over the type while taking the function as its sole argument
//
//type = type instanceof BlockType ? type : getBlockTypeForEncoding(type); // and since Block's constructor is 'private' (i.e. hidden behind subclass's constructor), we delete this line



/*
Important: the Block constructor uses fn.length to determine the number of arguments it should pass to the callback function; if the function takes 1 less argument than the number of arguments in the ObjC encoding string, it omits the block as first argument to callback.

This means that the encoding string *must* represent the block's canonical type; i.e. its first argument is always '@', which is the ObjC block itself. The alternative would be to pass an explicit flag:

  objc.blocks.define(FUNCTION[,SKIP_BLOCK_ARGUMENT=true/false]),)
  
which would mean that the number of arguments to pass to the callback is always known, and comparing argc can be used to check that the callback takes the correct number of [formal] arguments.

Caution: fn.length doesn't count named parameters that have a default value, nor ...rest; however, this'd only be an issue if user was recycling an existing function written for non-ObjC related code. In general, functions passed to a Block's constructor will be written specifically for use in that block.
