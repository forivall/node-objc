// TO DO: rename `subclass`
//
// TO DO: this API needs more thought
//
// the goal is to make JS classes callable from ObjC, but this API is not elegant and is not integrated with new instance.js implementation, so it won't add newly created classes to the `objc` namespace
//
// in an ideal world, users would write `class Foo extends objc.NSObject {â€¦}` but really not sure if that's technically feasible (at minimum, the resulting Foo class would need explicitly passed to an `objc.registerAsObjCClass()` to register it with objc's Class cache (or can we do that during first instantiation, when JS presumably calls JS class's parent's constructor?)
//
// during class registration, we should be able to introspect it for methods, relying on '$NAME' vs 'NAME' to distinguish class ("$tatic") methods from instance methods; however, we'd still need a way to annotate each JS method with an ObjC type signature, so will need more thought
